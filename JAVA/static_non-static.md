In Java, the static keyword and the absence of it (non-static) define how members (variables, methods, blocks, and nested classes) behave in relation to the class and its objects (instances).

Here's a breakdown of static and non-static in Java:

Static Members
When a member is declared with the static keyword, it belongs to the class itself, rather than to any specific instance (object) of that class.

Key Characteristics of Static Members:

Belongs to the Class: There is only one copy of a static member per class, regardless of how many objects of that class are created. It's shared by all instances.
Memory Allocation: Static members are allocated memory only once, when the class is loaded into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This happens before any objects of the class are created.
Access: You can access static members directly using the class name, without needing to create an object of the class.
Syntax: ClassName.staticMemberName
Cannot Access Non-Static Members Directly: A static method or block cannot directly access non-static (instance) variables or call non-static methods. This is because non-static members require an object to exist, and a static context doesn't guarantee the existence of an object. To access a non-static member from a static context, you must first create an object of the class.
this and super Keywords: The this and super keywords cannot be used inside static methods or blocks because they refer to the current object instance, which doesn't exist in a static context.
Overriding: Static methods cannot be overridden. Method overriding is a concept of polymorphism that applies to instance methods.
Use Cases:
Utility Methods: For functions that don't need any instance-specific data (e.g., mathematical operations like Math.sqrt()).
Constants: For values that are constant across all instances of a class (e.g., Math.PI).
Counting Instances: To keep track of the number of objects created for a class.
Shared Resources: To manage a single shared resource among all objects.
main method: The main method in Java is always static, which allows the JVM to call it without creating an object of the class.

Example (Static):

Java

class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Static variable: shared by all instances

    Counter() {
        count++; // Increments the shared count for every new object
    }

    static void displayCount() {
        System.out.println("Total objects created: " + count);
    }
}

public class StaticExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
        Counter c3 = new Counter();

        Counter.displayCount(); // Accessing static method using class name
        // System.out.println(c1.count); // Also works, but discouraged as it implies instance-specific
    }
}
Non-Static (Instance) Members
When a member is declared without the static keyword, it is a non-static member. These members belong to individual instances (objects) of the class.

Key Characteristics of Non-Static Members:

Belongs to the Instance: Each object of a class gets its own unique copy of non-static variables. Non-static methods operate on the data of the specific object they are called on.
Memory Allocation: Non-static members are allocated memory when a new object of the class is created using the new keyword. Each object has its own separate memory space for its non-static members.
Access: You must create an object of the class to access non-static members.
Syntax: objectName.nonStaticMemberName
Can Access Static Members: Non-static methods and blocks can access both static and non-static members directly. This is because a non-static context (an object) exists, and that object can "see" the class-level static members.
this and super Keywords: The this keyword refers to the current object instance, and super refers to the parent class's instance. They are commonly used within non-static methods.
Overriding: Non-static methods can be overridden in subclasses, which is a core concept of polymorphism.
Use Cases:
Instance-Specific Data: To store unique data for each object (e.g., name and age for a Person object).
Behavior Tied to an Object: For actions that manipulate the data of a specific object (e.g., a bark() method for a Dog object).
Example (Non-Static):
